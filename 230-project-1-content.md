Simple Geometry Graphics

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player will be able to move around the box playing field. Player health is deducted when an obstacle collides with the player. 
Obstacles spawn outside of the box and move across in different directions to make playing more difficult. The game ends when the player
runs out of health.

### Controls
- keyboard:
  - WASD
  - arrows
  - "p/P" for pause
  
### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
It's fairly obvious how to play the game and really won't require a tutorial. The player will realize that getting hit by obstacles deals damage and leads to the player dying. This will be obvious through visual cues. The player will know they are progressing each time the box is reset and text appears to announce the new wave of obstacles.
 
### Player Learning
There isn't too much to learn other than memorizing the patterns of each wave to know where the player needs to move.
